Atoms, Bits, and Growth

In the year my grandfather was born, the Supersonic Jet Engine, Synthetic Rubber, and the modern microscope was invented. The year my father was born, the laser, the halogen lamp, and the first GPS satellite was invented. The year I was the modern internet was invented by bringing Tim Berners Lee’s proposal: “World Wide Web: Proposal for a Hypertext Project” to life with the first website.

Try to smooth out the transition between these to thoughts.... 

Last weekend I was out for a morning walk with my dog and got a push notification onto my phone, Eric Weinstein was talking on Clubhouse. The room was titled, “Why are Scientists, The Media, and our Politicians Lying to us?” I knew this was going to be great content. For those that don’t know Eric, he is a heterodox thinker, Managing Director of Thiel capital, and the person who coined the term “The Intellectual Dark Web”. In the past year he has had some brushes with the Bitcoin Community at large.

I’ve listened to Eric for years as he is able to lay out mental models that help me see the world differently, or as he calls them “Portals”, a phenomena he named his podcast after called “The Portal”. In that clubhouse room, he attributes the cross-institutional decay to an idea that caught my attention, “Embedded Growth Obligation.”  I had head this term before, on his inaugural podcast episode from 2019 with Peter Thiel labeled, “An Era of Stagnation & Universal Institional Failure”.

I went back and listened to that episode, and the 3 hour discussion they had is the inspiration for this article. I hope to lay out some foundational ideas that was discussed between the two of them, and how, yes Eric, Bitcoin fixes this.

First, lets define some terms.

I want to start with institutions, because I believe it is important to be precise when we talk about problems, and I’ll be using that word a lot this article. A group of people that self organized with a shared common goal are an institution. The Catholic Church, the New York Times, and your local sports teams are all example of institutions. They serve a vital role in a healthy culture as they all everyone as individuals to operate as groups on agreed terms. If I’m a member of the local Parent Teachers Association board, all issues that are not about educating our children are not part of the conversation. We are all focused on a shared common goal.

The Embedded Growth Obligation (EGO), is how fast an institution has to grow for it to maintain its honest positions. Take a very simple example in where this is easily identifiable, Universities. A Professor teaches many Grad Students, many of whom wish to become Professors themselves. When the Grad Students graduate, many wish go on and become a Professor teach their own cohort of Grad Students. Anyone familiar with a Ponzi Scheme can see that this is very quickly unsustainable after a few cycles. 

What happens when growth stops though? Eric and Peter posit, our institutions become parasitic and sociopathic. Intuitions begin disregarding whatever their stated purpose was and look inward, trying to grow at all costs. Furthermore, institutions insulate them with a priestly class of experts who claim to have sole authority over what is true, and even constructing the means by which we measure our reality. Look no further than our trusted class of economists that tell you inflation is not the money supply increasing, but an elaborate series of calculations and weightings to assert that inflation is only 5.4% year over year when 30% of all dollars that ever existed were created since January of 2020.

College students are taking ever increasing amounts of debt, subsided by our government, for what? Who is this actually serving? Has the education or job prospects gotten better? The economic data is pretty clear we are paying more for a lower quality service. I’d argue it is not the college student, but the intuition of “education” student loans serve. The institution is further entrenched in power by with coordinating with government to enact policies that make discharging of student debt illegal. Spurning the individual in service of not even “the group” of society as a whole, but to uphold an idealized version of our educational system. 

Social security becoming insolvent? Benefits can never be cut as they were promised, so borrow money to make the difference. Print media can no longer grow technology plays an increasing role in our lives? Discard nuance, acquire clicks. Get growin’ or die tryin’. No institution is exempt from the treadmill that is Embedded Growth Obligations.

A prisoner dilemma forms, if anyone was honest about the inability to grow forever, you’ll get crowded out. For example, If you ran a law firm where all of the associates could one day make partner BUT their salaries would be capped so everyone could make partner, you’d lose the best talent and they would go work elsewhere. To lead an intuition is to participate in this shared lie.

There is a group immune to embedded growth obligations, individuals. Individuals who are not reliant on institutions to put food on the table for their family, they have freedom speak the truth as best they can see it. This attribute is what aligns Bitcoiners as allies in the war of addressing this problem, but more on that later.

At this point I would understand some pushback. Isn’t growth a good thing? Don’t we want more academics helping invent the new technologies of tomorrow? That brings about the second thesis I learned from listening to this discussion between Eric and Peter. The great stagnation.

Peter and Eric talk discuss that during the late 1960s and early 1970s there was a moment when technological development diverged. 

In the world of Atoms, the frontier of engineering the physical world has had little progress. In the world of bits, we have seen exponential growth in computers, the internet, mobile devices, and the tech startups out of silicon valley. Moore’s law, which is the historical trend that the number of transistors on a microchip can double every two years, has been a great source of growth. In the world of Bitcoin, Bitmain’s S9, a bitcoin miner, was released at the end of 2017, and uses 90 Watts to generate 1 TH/s.  The S19j released this month uses 30 Watts to generate 1 TH/s. Hardware 3.5 years apart has gained an efficiency of 66%. That is a growth rate that would make even the most ambitious of intuitions envious.

Thiel surmises this in a metaphor that I think drives the point. Silicon Valley has been aggressively pushing the boundaries of what is possible in building the Star Trek computer. To the point where we may even view it as somewhat antiquated given what people are familiar with today in having a supercomputer in their pocket. You can swap out “Computer” as Captain Piccard would bark out, with “Hey Siri” and see we already live in that future world.

On the other hand, none of the accompanying technologies have been developed or seen meaningful progress. There is no warp drive, there is no holodeck, there is no replicator. Man has conquered bits but is a slave to the constraints of atoms. A lot of the arrested growth post 1970 is wrestling with the fact we have made leaps to achieving the Star Trek computer but nothing else in the star trek world. We landed on the moon in July of 1969, and there is a big media fanfare because billionaires broke the atmospheric barrier over 50 years later? Where did our ambitions go?  

Eric phrases it another way. If you were to walk into a room and subtract all of the screens, what beyond style and taste has truly changed than a room from the 1970s? As a millennial personally I don’t have a direct lived experience of what a 1970s room looked like to validate. I looked through some family albums though, and Eric is right, nothing has changed.

The world of bits though, is not immune to stagnation. The first iPhone and the latest outside of a few cosmetic changes functionally is the same. There are faster runtimes and camera quality thanks to Moore’s law, but there is no large step function in innovation like pre smartphone to post smartphone. Anyone in the world of bitcoin mining will tell you, that we are starting to hit a wall in additional efficiency to be gained on future generation miners. What happens if growth begins to stagnate in the world of bits too? What if the parabolic growth in the world of bits that fueled the past 50 years of economic development is about to run out of gas? How do we go forward?

Up to this point, I’ve done my best to summarize the two biggest takeaways I learned from that conversation. Embedded Growth Obligations, and the Great Stagnation in the world of atoms. At no point in this 3 hour dialogue though is Bitcoin, or even the money is mentioned. They are so close! Peter targets identifies that the great stagnation occurred somewhere between 1968 and 1973, Eric targets it as 1971-73 (Shoutout to the wtfhappenedin1971.com crew). I’d like to walk through how I’ve unified what has been discussed so far to the world of Bitcoin. 

In 1970 the US had a GDP of 1.073 Trillion. In 2020 it had a GDP of 20.93 Trillion. That is a CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate) of 6% over 50 years. That is an impressive growth rate over half a century! The source of where that growth occurred though is of contention. By no means am I claiming that all of the growth was fraudulent, we can thank Moore’s Law for a lot of that organic growth, but not all growth is equal. We have to look beyond the top line number to learn more.

Debt markets are where the gaming of growth metrics occurs. When a person, company, or Government borrow money, consumption and growth happens in the present with resources owed to the future. If too much was being taken from the future to pay for the present, ie there was a demand that paced supply of bond issuers, interest rates would rise causing a greater reflection on if the debt was truly worth it. 

Interest rates are the manifestation of the negotiation between present and future. As interest rates increase, economic miscalculation in the present has a greater punishment, and the greater the reward it is to delay gratification into the future.

What happens though when an intuition has gone parasitic, say the lender of last resort, The Federal Reserve? Since growth has been empowered by borrowing, and The Fed is the backstop to the financial markets, they are the Chief Growth Officer of the country.

When The Fed enters the open market and begins buying treasury bonds, they are bowing to the altar of embedded growth. Maybe it should not have been such a surprise that interest rates had to be bent to the will of our embedded growth obligation?

It goes beyond Treasury bonds, the housing market is at all time highs, and yet the Federal Reserve continues to put 40 Billion a MONTH into buying mortgage backed securities. Not only is your ability to save into the future hurt with lower interest rates, but the things you need in life to have a stable environment to raise a family like a home are being monetized out of your reach with ever rising home prices.

The first 30 year bond was auctioned in 1977, which is a considerable break from previous debt instruments that lasted 10 years or less. Long dated debt can have an honest role in a society. For example, an Insurance Company has long dated liabilities of paying out policies into the future, so accompanying that with a long term debt instrument is a responsible way to hedge.

The interest rate of a 30 year bond has an implicit compact. Among those currently at the wheel, how much are they willing to leave to future generations? We often evaluate our leaders based on what generation are they? From boomers to zoomers and everything in between. What if its more complicated than that? What if those who are in power have the gun of Embedded Growth Obligations pointed to their head to hit the money printer button? Are they slaves to the system they helped build?

As the 30 year interest rate drops further over, less and less is being left for the future in the service of today’s embedded growth obligations. To the point where major countries have gone negative, there is no growth that can be left for the future. Put more bluntly, our ruling class of overwhelmingly greatest generation and baby boomers are sacrificing the futures of the millennial and gen z onto a financial pyre in the service of the one true God, the embedded Growth obligation. 

So what do we do as Bitcoiners? We form our own intuitions on a founding principle. There will only ever be 21 Million Bitcoin. There is no embedded growth obligation in Bitcoin’s monetary supply. Greg Foss has described Bitcoin as a credit default swap on the central banks and money printing. I believe he is right, but It goes even further. Bitcoin is a credit default swap on Embedded Growth Obligations as a whole.

How does this impact the world of atoms? I believe the marginal efforts toiling in the world of bits had a much greater financial and political upside because of Moore’s Law. Embedded Growth Obligations rewarded the low hanging fruit of conquering the world of bits. Additionally, The Fed stepping into debt markets and artificially suppressing interest rates to perpetuate growth made riskier longer dated investments in the world of atoms less appealing. If you are able to have parabolic growth in bits, why would you both trying to conquest the world of atoms? How many great minds that should have been physicists and chemists ended up being software engineers at a FAANG company because it paid more?

Our institutions are failing us as they are in a Malthusian Struggle. If natural growth is hitting a wall, all remaining assets are zero sum conquests. You can only gain more by taking from someone else. That is why so many tech companies have become myopic. Google once had “Don’t Be Evil” in their code of conduct, but when it hindered it had to be removed. 

Eric in the podcast rightly points out that Increasing energy consumption is required for growth, and growth puts off violence. The promise Bitcoin Mining has, where no megawatt of energy goes wasted is a national security and energy grid blessing. We can directly incentive increased energy consumption, and increase the efficacy at which we consume energy that has been produced.

I’d like to leave as a parting thought a quote Thiel mentions in that episode of The Portal.

“One of the challenges, and we should not understate how big it is in resetting science and technology in the 21st century is, how do we tell a story that motivates sacrifice, incredible hard work and differed gratification to the future that is not intrinsically violent?”

Bitcoin is an integral part to answer this question. This goes far beyond personal monetary gain. I see a bright orange future where Bitcoiners, where we are not caught up in quarterly earnings, but on developing intergenerational wealth. It is not enough that I succeed, my Great Great Grand Children that I may never meet must thrive. Bitcoiners will become the capital allocators or tomorrow, with projects that may not have payoffs in our lifetime. Bitcoiners will have a seat at the table to check the parasitic Embedded Growth Obligation, and make sure that Bitcoin as spoken truth, will stop the lies and build a better world for our descendants to live in.
